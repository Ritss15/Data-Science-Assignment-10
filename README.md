# Data-Science-Assignment-10
# Week 10 – Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (Customer Churn)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on data preprocessing and feature engineering
for a customer churn prediction problem.

## Dataset
- customer_churn.csv (500 records)

## Preprocessing Steps
- Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
- Feature Scaling (Min-Max, Standard Scaling)
- Outlier handling using IQR
- Feature engineering (5+ new features)
- Feature selection using correlation analysis

## Outcome
A complete preprocessing pipeline was built, producing
model-ready data for churn prediction.
